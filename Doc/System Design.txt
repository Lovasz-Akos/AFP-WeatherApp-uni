1. Goal of the system
We aimed to create a simple, intuitive, beautiful weather app,
that's ran in the cloud, thus supporting just about every device that can load the page.
We feel that many if not most weather sites compact information too densely and provide too much data
that isn't truely useful, such as sattelite and radar images of could formations have close to no meaning to
the every day user.


2. Project plan
Contributors.                Roles.                        

1.Lovász Ákos       > Original idea, Project manager, Documentation, 
2.Bálint Krigovszki > UI Designer, Documentation
3.Om Parkash        > Backend programmer, Documentation
4.Yang Yizhou       > Backend/Frontend programmer, Documentation


3. Business process model
There is search bar on the picture ,user input a location in the bar,
then the weather information of that location will be shown

4. Requirements
The site has to achieve the following goals:
    -Simple, intuitive interface
    -Ability to search for any city/town
    -Display current weather with termperature
    -Display weather forecast


5. Functional plan
As the site provides no option to register an account, we don't need to set up differing levels of permissions
or access levels to different features. We provide all the functionality as-is.


6. Physical enviorement
the platform for the program is visual studio code , and it was created by Javascript , HTML and CSS .


7. Architectural plan


8. Implementation plan


9. Testing plan


10. Install plan
As this is a self-contained web application, it can be hosted on basically any computer with an internet connection.
The API key used for weather data communication is hardcoded into the JS, as it should not be accessed by any users
outside of the system admin.


11. Maintenance plan
Since the interface was designed to be as dynamic as possible, the only part of the app that could require maintenance
is the weather data API itself. This API key can easily be changed by adjusting a single variable in the code,
this will update all occurances of the API key.
