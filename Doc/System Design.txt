1. Goal of the system
We aimed to create a simple, intuitive, beautiful weather app,
that's ran in the cloud, thus supporting just about every device that can load the page.
We feel that many if not most weather sites compact information too densely and provide too much data
that isn't truely useful, such as sattelite and radar images of could formations have close to no meaning to
the every day user.
